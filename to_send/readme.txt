Hi, this is Davide, Dario and Benjamin's project!


Before going further, download the rest of the data (the dataset) from:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_jjpgHAwdd0pydUHUYboHhVWVN6IBZVb/view?usp=sharing



If you want to check out the final product, run rpn_test.py.
(It may take a bit to initially show anything because it has to load 1 gb of weights, quantized)

If you want to check out some statistics, run the other .pys in this main folder.
If you want to try the trainers, there are two! One older and one newer, each in the respective folder of their models.
If you want to check out the document, it is in the ./docs folder.

Otherwise, you are free to check out the rest!
(There are a couple other readme-s around, look out!)
